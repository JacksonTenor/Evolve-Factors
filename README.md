# propel

Lee Spector's Plushification of Tom Helmuth's little Push GP implementation in Clojure.

## Usage

To run from repl, load propel.core into your repl (i.e. `lein repl`), and run `(-main)`.

To run from command line, `lein run`. Command-line arguments may be provided to override the defaults specified in `-main`, for example, `lein run :population-size 100`.
